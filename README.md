# My React Trading App

Introduction

Welcome to My React Trading App, a real-time trading data visualization project. This application uses data from the Binance API to show real-time trades and ticker data. It has two main tables for showing Recent Trades and 24-hour Ticker Data.

The project is developed using React, TypeScript, and other modern web technologies. We've implemented end-to-end testing using Express and unit testing with Jest. Our components are visually tested and documented using Storybook.
